# Overview of Election Audit

Using Python we were able to take the raw csv file with individual votes and determine who the winner of the election was as well as other descriptive information. The purpose was to streamline the election process as well as generate descriptive statistics.

# Results

* Winner: Diana Degette
* Winning Vote Count: 272,892
* Winning Percentage: 73.8%
* Largest County Turnout: Denver
* Total Votes: 369,711

# Summary

With our code we were able to quickly determine who the winner of the election was, and can be used in any election. The program can be modified to process multiple elections at the same time if voters wished to cast ballots for multiple races on the same sheet. One way to do this would be by creating functions to hold the 'for loops' giving the program more versatility. There should also be some redundancy built within the code in order to check for errors ensuring election integrity.
